# This message is designed to capture the returns extracted/derived from a sonar
# ping. The range, azimuth, and elevation vectors describe the positions of the
# returns in spherical coordinates (in the sonar's reference frame). They should
# support different types of sonar:
#  - single-beam (az=el=0, as returns are assumed to be on the beam's main axis)
#  - multi-beam (typically el=0)
#  - split-beam (may have non-zero values for azimuth and elevation)
#
# This specification follows sensor_msgs::LaserScan closely
# and takes its recommendation to create a specialized type for sonar
